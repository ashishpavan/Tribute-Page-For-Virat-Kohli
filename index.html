      <h2>Elon Musk co-founded and leads Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company.</h2>
      <p><i class="fas fa-birthday-cake"></i> Born on June 28, 1971 in South Africa</p>
      <p><i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> In 1983, at the age of 12,he sold a simple game called "Blastar" to a computer magazine for $500.</p>
      <p><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Graduated in 1997 with a BS degree in economics and a BA degree in physics</p>
      <p><i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> Launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal Musk. </p>
      <p><i class="fab fa-cc-paypal"></i> Musk next started X.com, an online banking company. He launched the company in 1999 using $10 million of the money he got from the Zip2 sale. About a year later, X.com merged with Confinity, a financial
        startup cofounded by Peter Thiel, to form PayPal.</p>
      <p><i class="fas fa-car"></i> Since the company’s inception in 2003,<a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="_blank" id="tribute-link"> Tesla’s</a> mission has been to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. The first Tesla
        product, the Roadster sports car, debuted in 2008, followed by the Model S sedan, which was introduced in 2012, and the Model X SUV, which launched in 2015. Model S received Consumer Reports’ Best Overall Car and has been named the Ultimate
        Car of the Year by Motor Trend, while Model X was the first SUV ever to earn 5-star safety ratings in every category and sub-category in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s tests. In 2017, Tesla began deliveries of Model 3, a
        mass-market electric vehicle with more than 320 miles of range, and unveiled Tesla Semi, which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Cybertruck, which will have
        better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car, as well as the Model Y compact SUV, which began customer deliveries in early 2020.</p>
      <p><i class="fas fa-space-shuttle"></i> As lead designer at <a href="https://www.spacex.com/" target="_blank" id="tribute-link"> SpaceX,</a> Elon oversees the development of rockets and spacecraft for missions to Earth orbit and ultimately to
        other planets. In 2008, the SpaceX Falcon 1 was the first privately developed liquid fuel rocket to reach orbit, and SpaceX made further history in 2017 by re-flying both a Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft for the first time. Soon after,
        Falcon Heavy, the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two, completed its first flight in 2018. In 2019, SpaceX’s crew-capable version of the Dragon spacecraft completed its first demonstration mission, and the company
        will fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station for the first time in 2020. Building on these achievements, SpaceX is developing Starship – a fully reusable transportation system that will carry crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars
        and beyond ­– and Starlink, which will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable. By pioneering reusable rockets, SpaceX is pursuing the long-term goal of making
        humans a multi-planet species by creating a self-sustaining city on Mars.</p>
      <p><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Elon is also CEO of <a href="https://neuralink.com/" target="_blank" id="tribute-link"> Neuralink,</a> which is developing ultra-high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect the human brain to computers.
      </p>
      <p><i class="fas fa-archway"></i> He also launched <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/" target="_blank" id="tribute-link"> The Boring Company,</a> which combines fast, affordable tunneling technology with an all-electric public
        transportation system in order to alleviate soul-crushing urban congestion and enable high-speed, long-distance travel. The Boring Company built a 1.15 mile R&D tunnel in Hawthorne, and is currently constructing Vegas Loop, a public
        transportation system at the Las Vegas Convention Center.</p>
